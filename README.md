# Canvas-Editor
Angular HTML Canvas based editor and custom .docx serializer


TODOS:
  - Smooth Out cursor behavior
    - First targeting insert/delete positioning as well as Arrow Key Movement
    - Second pass will target cursor click positioning (Still unsure how that'll be handled)
    - Third iron out cursor selection for text operations (Delete, highlight, etc...)
    
   - Research and potentially switch to Piece Table Data Structure. (Might currenty be going the wrong route...Live and learn :smile:)
   
   - Fixing the canvas resolution did mess up the canvas sizing itself. I'll need to debug and address as well.
